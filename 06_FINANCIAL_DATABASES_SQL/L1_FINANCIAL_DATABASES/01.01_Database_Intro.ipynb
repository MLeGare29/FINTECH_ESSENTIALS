    "# SQL is a language that was designed to help manage and analyze data within databases.\n",

    "# DATABASES vs. DATAFRAMES\n",
    "# To understand databases, we'll first revisit CSV files and DataFrames.\n",
    "# So far, besides when APIs were the main source of data in Module 5, most of the data provided has been TABULAR DATA, or CSV files.\n",
    "# TABULAR DATA is good for storing small amounts of data that don't change much.\n",
    "# However, you've observed the dynamic and varied nature of financial data, therefore, text files just aren't sufficient for analyzing or working with dynamic data.\n",
    "# There was a revelation that financial technologists needed more dynamic ways to access and work with data.\n",
    "# So a data container in Python, called a DataFrame, was created. \n",
    "# A DataFrame stores the rows and columns of CSV data in a container that many tools can access.\n",
    "# These tools help us manipulate and analyze the data. \n",
    "# Databases are thus like DataFrames in that they're designed to store, access, and analyze data.\n",
