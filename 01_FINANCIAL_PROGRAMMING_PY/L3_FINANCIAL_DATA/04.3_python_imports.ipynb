    "import pathlib\n",
    "\n",
    "# This tells Python that you want to use the `pathlib` library in your code.\n",
    "# Often, we just want to use one specific function from a library. \n",
    "# In these cases, we can use the format `from ``import x`` ``import y```.\n",
    "# However, in this case, we really just want the `Path` function from the `pathlib` library.\n",
    "# Therefore, we input the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now that `Path` from the `pathlib` library is imported, you can use it to create a path to the same folder that the code file sits in.\n",
    "# In the following code, remember that \".\" represents the current directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_directory = Path(\".\")\n",
    "print(my_directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code creates a path object.\n",
    "# A PATH OBJECT contains information about the location of the file on your computer.\n",
    "# Let's say we have a CSV file named data.csv in the same location as the Python file.\n",
    "# We can use the `Path` operator from the `pathlib` library to retrieve it.\n",
    "# To use just one component of a library, use the syntax `from library import operator`:\n",
