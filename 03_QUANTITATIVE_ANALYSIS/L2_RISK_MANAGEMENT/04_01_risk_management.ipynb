    "# EVALUATING FINANCIAL RISK\n",
    "# Quantitative financial analysts must explore beyond daily and cumulative returns to evaluate an asset for investment.\n",
    "# They need to measure the asset's risk.\n",
    "# RISK is the chance that an investment's acutal return will differ from its expected or predicted return.\n",
    "# In this context, we usually asses risk by quantifying historical patterns and outcomes.\n",
    "# Risk helps quantify the possibility of making $20,000 from a $10,000 investment, or making $0, or even losing money.\n",
    "# We balance the risk metric of an investment by that investment's return.\n",
    "# Quantitative financial analysts have a primary goal of RISK MANAGEMENT.\n",
    "# This means determining the amount of return that an investment generates for each unit of risk that's associated with the investment.\n",
    "# When creating an investment portfolio, we need to evaluate the risk-return relationship.\n",
    "# The goal is to generate the largest cumulative return for the least amount of assumed risk.\n",
    "# In this lesson, you'll use Pandas to generate statistics and visualizations.\n",
    "# The purpose is to measure the risk of a single investment and to compare risk measures across multiple investments.\n",
    "# By measuring risk, you can better assess and manage the risk-return profile of a portfolio for better investment results."
