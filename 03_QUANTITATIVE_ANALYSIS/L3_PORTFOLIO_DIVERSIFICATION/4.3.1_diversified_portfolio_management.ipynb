    "# ASSESSING RISK TOLERANCE\n",
    "# Every investor has their own RISK TOLERANCE, or the amount of risk they feel willing to take on.\n",
    "# For example, younger people are more prone to having higher risk tolerances due to their age, while older people are more conservative with their investments due to the time window.\n",
    "# This dynamic is applied to portfolios.\n",
    "# Investment advisors and publications encourage young investors to have portfolios that contain 80% stocks and 20% bonds.\n",
    "# Stocks have a sizably greater risk profile than bonds.\n",
    "# Though this portfolio has greater risk, it can attain solid growth over time.\n",
    "# As investors age, it is advised for them to evolve their portfolio allocation to 40% stocks and 60% bonds.\n",
    "# The investor will still incur some risk, while allowing the portfolio to take advantage of economic growth.\n",
    "# However, a healthy bond allocation offsets the risk for that growth, protecting a large part of their investment."

    "# ASSESS DIVERSIFICATION\n",
    "# One way to manage risk within a portfolio is to own various stocks in the stock SLEEVE, or section, of the portfolio and various bonds in the bond sleeve.\n",
    "# Investing the entire stock portion of your portfolio in one stock is risky.\n",

    "# In contrast, if that stock has small values for risk metrics, you might miss out on the portfolio's return.\n",
    "# A well managed stock sleeve has a combination of stocks from various industries and sectors, all of which exhibit different risk characteristics.\n",
    "# Splitting a portfolio among multiple stocks and bonds demonstrates PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION.\n",
    "# This risk management strategy combines various assets into an investment portfolio to reduce its overall risk.\n",
    "# Portfolio diversification helps investors meet their investment goals while managing the risk they take on to reach those goals.\n",
    "# The portfolio diversification strategy can change over time as the investor's goals change.\n",
    "# In addition to managing risk, portfolio diversification aims to outperform the market.\n",
