    "# INTRODUCTION TO RESOLVING IMBALANCED CLASSES\n",
    "# IMBALACED CLASSES present us with a common classification problem.\n",
    "# This occurs when the size of one class greatly exceeds that of the other class.\n",
    "# As we found in the previous lesson, if someone works for a credit card company and wants to detect fraud transactions, they'll have many more transactions that aren't fraud than transactions that are.\n",
    "# In this case, the size of the 'not fraud' class greatly exceeds that of the 'fraud' class.\n",
    "# One approach to solving the imbalanced class problem involves RESAMPLING.\n",
    "# RESAMPLING is a way to artificially balance the classes that the model gets during training.\n",
    "# This helps the model avoid hyperfocusing on the larger class and can improve the predictions for the smaller class.\n",
    "# Three types of resampling techniques exist:\n",
    "    # 1. Oversampling\n",
    "    # 2. Undersampling\n",
    "    # 3. Combination sampling\n",
    "# In this lesson we'll discuss all three, but focus on oversampling."

    "# TYPES OF RESAMPLING\n",
    "# In this lesson, we'll address imbalanced classes with resampling techniques.\n",
    "# Most of these techniques fall into the following two categories: \n",
    "    # 1. OVERSAMPLING: Creating more instances of a class label, usually for the smaller class.\n",
    "    # 2. UNDERSAMPLING: Creating fewer instances of a class label, usually for the larger class.\n",
    "# We can do both oversampling and undersampling before choosing a model, like logistic regression.\n",
    "# If we have imbalanced classes, doing this step in advance can improve the predictive performance of the model.\n",
    "# In a later lesson, we'll learn about models that have resampling built in.\n",
    "# Various oversampling, undersampling, and combination sampling techniques exist:\n",
    "    # 1. OVERSAMPLING TECHNIQUES:\n",
    "        # Random oversampling\n",
    "        # Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)\n",
    "    # 2. UNDERSAMPLING TECHNIQUES:\n",
    "        # Random undersampling\n",
    "        # Cluster centroid\n",
    "    # 3. COMBINATION SAMPLING TECHNIQUE:\n",
    "        # SMOTE & EDITED NEAREST NEIGHBORS (ENN), or SMOTEENN\n",
    "# By resampling our data, we have the chance to create better performing machine learning models.\n",
    "# And, the more resampling techniques we have, the better our chances are of identifying one that works will for our current data.\n",
    "# In this lesson, we'll cover oversampling and go over random oversampling in detail."
