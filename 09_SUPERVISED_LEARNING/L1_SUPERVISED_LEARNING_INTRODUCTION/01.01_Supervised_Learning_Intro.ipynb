    "# INTRODUCTION TO SUPERVISED LEARNING\n",
    "# In earlier lessons, we showed the importance of measuring risk when making financial decisions.\n",
    "# We used risk metrics and analytics to make decisions about the market, investments, and even retirement portfolios.\n",
    "# Financial risk is a serious concern in other areas of finance too, such as credit, lending, and insurance.\n",
    "# Because many factors relate to risk, we need better tools to consider various components for making predictions about the future.\n",
    "# In face, FinTech companies have moved beyond traditional risk analytics and are starting to use machine learning to model and predict risk.\n",
    "# In this lesson, you'll learn about the field of machine learning called SUPERVISED LEARNING.\n",
    "# Supervised Learning trains an algorithm to learn based on a labeled dataset, where each item in the dataset is tagged with the answer.\n",
    "# This provides an answer key that you can use to evaluate the accuracy of the training data.\n",
    "# Supervised learning can consider multiple factors and known past outcomes to make predictions about future outcomes, such as financial risk.\n",
    "# By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to define supervised learning and explain how FinTech can use it.\n",
    "# You'll also compare and contrast regression and classification.\n",
    "# Finally, you'll describe the model-fit-predict patter that is used to create, train, and use machine learning model."

    "# WHAT IS SUPERVISED LEARNING?\n",
    "# We typically divide machine learning into three main categories:\n",
    "    # 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "    # 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "    # 3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "# As previously explained, we can use unsupervised learning for knowledge discovery and clustering.\n",
    "# By contrast, supervised learning can learn from the data and the expected outcomes that you choose to feed into it.\n",
    "# If you supply the data and the expected outcome together, the model can learn how to make predictions for new pieces of data that have similar features.\n",
    "# You SUPERVISE the model's learning by feeding it carefully selected data with known outcomes that the model can use to make the most accurate predictions that are possible.\n",
    "# For example, assume that you have a dataset of high risk vs low risk loans and the factors that led to those results.\n",
    "# You can use that information to improve the model's predictive capability.\n",
    "# That is, models can oftern learn from their mistakes.\n",
    "# If a model's prediction is slightly off, it can adjust itself to become even better the next time that it gets that data.\n",
    "# And once trained, a supervised learning model can predict the outcome of a new piece of data, such as a new consumer loan."
