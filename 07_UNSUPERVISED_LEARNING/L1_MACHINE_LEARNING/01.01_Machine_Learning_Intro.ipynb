    "# INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING\n",
    "# Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and statistical models to make decisions or predictions about data.\n",
    "# Along with today's computer power, machine learning is changing the financial world faster than ever before.\n",
    "# This is happening especially because of the automation power that provides quicker and more efficient decisions than ever.\n",
    "# Machine learning is disrupting the financial world by detecting fraud in a matter of seconds, predicting stock prices and revenue for the next year, and understanding human languages to offer financial advice via robotic advisors.\n",
    "# In this lesson, you'll learn what machine learning is an dhow to identify machine learning models in finance."

    "# THE MYSTICISM OF MACHINE LEARNING\n",
    "# Machine learning has become a buzzword that almost everyone has heard in the tech and FinTech worlds.\n",
    "# Self-driving cars, chatbots, and surprisingly accurate text generators frequently make headlines and news.\n",
    "# Despite the mainstream use of the term, most people still don't know what machine learning really is.\n",
    "# In essence, MACHINE LEARNING is the practice of applying computer algorithms and statistics that can learn from data and then make decisions or predictions about future data.\n",
    "# We've already been writing code that can make decisions by using explicit conditional statements and logic.\n",
    "# Machine learning algorithms learn how to make decisions without needing anyone to program all the logic.\n",
    "# They learn patterns, behavior, and logic on their own directly from the data an then use that knowledge to make decisions and predictions.\n",
    "# If machine learning consists of just computer algorithms and statistics, you might wonder how that differs from the computer programs that you wrote in Python.\n",
    "# The secret is that machine learning algorithms use MODELS - mathematical structures learned form data - to represent their knowledge to the world.\n",
    "# The algorithms learn from the data and then update the models to become more and more accurate at how well they make decisions and predictions."

    "# MACHINE LEARNING FOR FINANCIAL ADVISING\n",
    "# One intriguing use of machine learning is replacing the traditional financial advisor with AI.\n",
    "# For example, FinTech companies that automate saving for retirement include Wealthfront, Betterment, and SoFi.\n",
    "# Using machine learning to recommend tailored portfolis and manage the whole process means that customers no longer hav to pay high annual fees to traditional advisors.\n",
    "# And after all, millennials and later generations would rather talk to a screen than a person regarding their finances.\n",
    "# Such automation to reduce consts isn't isolated to FinTech products oriented toward end users, like individuals saving for retirment.\n",
    "# J.P Morgan, for example, has developed a program named COIN.\n",
    "# It uses natural languages processing (NLP) to automatically run due diligence on its commercial credit contract agreements.\n",
    "# These lines of code compress the 360,000 hours of work that humans previously did into seconds."

    "# MACHINE LEARNING FOR FORECASTING MARKET RESULTS\n",
    "# We also use machine learning models to forecast financial market results.\n",
    "# These forecasts range from loan evaluation (for example, predicting the default rates on bonds or consumer loans) to high-frequency algorithmic trading in the stock market.\n",
    "# Algorithmic trading that statistical models drive isn't necessarily new.\n",
    "# The quant hedge fund known as Two Sigma Securities, for example, automatically trades more than 300 million shares a day.\n",
    "# The fund has been in business since the early 2000s.\n",
    "# Within the last five years, however, algorithmic trading has come to account for 75% to 80% of all equity trades in the US.\n",
    "# This algorithmic trading includes the variety that decisions involving machine learning drive.\n",
    "# Furthermore, perhaps partly because of their purely virtual beginnings, more cryptocurrency exchanges and trading firms are seeking individuals who can write machine learning code that trades profitably."
