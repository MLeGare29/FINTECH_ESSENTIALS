    "    \n",
    "    # 1. Collect the data: \n",
    "    # In this phase, you collect the data for analysis by importing it into a container that Python and Pandas can work on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # 2. Prepare the data: \n",
    "    # In this phase, you clean the data to account for missing, incomplete, erroneous, and duplicated data.\n",
    "    # This phase also includes manipulating segments of the dataset to highlight relationships between variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # 3. Analyze the data:\n",
    "    # This phase consists of an iterative process and varies based on the goal of your analysis research.\n",
    "    # Regardless of the specifics, the analysis involves testing your thesis, reviewing the results, and refining both until you reach a conclusion.  "
