    "# INTRODUCTION TO TIME SERIES FORECASTING \n",
    "# The financial world widely uses time series forecasting.\n",
    "# This is because of its origins in the mathematics and statistics space.\n",
    "# People sometimes refer to time series forecasting as a statistical tool, but much overlap exists between statistical tools and machine learning models.\n",
    "# People tend to use both to solve similar problems.\n",
    "# As you leanred before, time series analysis involves analyzing time series data to identify meaningful patterns in data.\n",
    "# TIME SERIES FORECASTING involves using a model that's based on historical data to predict future values in the same time series.\n",
    "# In this lesson, you'll perform time series forecasting by creating models to predict the future."

    "# AUTOMATING TIME SERIES FORECASTING\n",
    "# Time series forcasting can prove challenging.\n",
    "# This is because numerous statistical techniques exist for us to use and because external factors can impact the typical behavior of the patterns.\n",
    "# Holidays, breaking news, and special events - such as the Olympics - are examples of external factors that can affect the behavior of time series data.\n",
    "# External factors, like weather holidays, impact a time series and sometimes introduce noise.\n",
    "# NOISE is information in the data that is essentially meaningless and distracts from the overall trend, or signal, of the data.\n",
    "# Noise acts as another independent variable in our models.\n",
    "# And some statistical techniques manually reduce it.\n",
    "# However, dealing with noise reduction adds more complexity to time series analysis.\n",
    "# Adjusting our models for it can prove time consuming."

    "# Prophet forecasts not only the growth of the social network, but also its technological infrastructure demand, services revenue, and fraudulent activity.\n",
    "# Prophet automates the process of time series forecasting, allowing you as a FinTech professional to focus on a business problem.\n",
    "# It also tests and forecasts as many scenarios as you identify.\n",
    "# Thanks to the forecasting automation of Prophet, you can use it to simplify your time series analysis.\n",
    "# It deals with noise, holidays, or special events, and time series decomposition - allowing you to work more efficiently.\n",
    "# In the next section, we will use Prophet in collaboration with Google Colab, to automate time series forcasting in a business scenario.\n",
    "# In the scenario, you'll contribute to reducing the impact of climate change by demonstrating the money earned over time through the use of solar panels."
