    "# An SDK is a collection of software tools that come in a single installable package.\n",
    "# Companies develop SDKs to ease accessing their data via API calls.\n",
    "# SDKs require us to use specific syntax when making API calls.\n",
    "# This syntax, which includes company-specific functions, streamlines the ability of the server to respond to API calls.\n",
    "# SDKs often require a level of user authentication that surpasses the level for more-generic API calls.\n",
    "# This is because the data that SDKs supply tend to have better quality - it's often cleaner and more current.\n",
    "# Although we use different syntax to make an API request via an SDK, we follow the same process that we use with the Python Requests library.\n",
    "# For example, to get data via the Alpaca SDK, we use the `get()` function.\n",
    "# SDKs also offer functions for filtering and calculating data that might prove more efficient than passing parameters in a request URL.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Example API call using a Request URL:\n",
