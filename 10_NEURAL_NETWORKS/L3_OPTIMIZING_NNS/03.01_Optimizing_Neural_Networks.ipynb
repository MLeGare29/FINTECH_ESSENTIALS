    "# OPTIMIZING TECHNIQUES FOR DATA PREPROCESSING\n",
    "# In this module, we have learned that - as for all machine learning algorithms - in order to use a neural network effectively, we must preprocess our data.\n",
    "# Neural networks cannon process categorical variables in their raw forms.\n",
    "# And it is often challenging to train neural networks on numerical variables that are represented in different units or that have different scales of magnitude.\n",
    "# We have previously used the `StandardScaler` module from scikit-learn to mitigate this problem for numerical variables.\n",
    "# This module scales the values of different variables by normalizing data to center around the mean.\n",
    "# We have also previously used the `get_dummies` function to solve this problem for categorical variables.\n",
    "# However, `get_dummies` can run into trouble if the testing dataset contains categories that are not present in the training dataset.\n",
    "# For example, consider the following scenario:\n",
    "    # 1. Our X_train dataset has a column named 'country' that contains the following categorical levels: 'canada', 'usa', mexico', 'colombia'.\n",
    "    # 2. Our X_test dataset has the following levels: 'canada', 'usa', 'mexico', 'colombia', 'spain',\n",
    "    # 3. Using the `get_dummies` function, X_test ends up with a column called 'country_spain'' that X_train doesn't have. \n",
    "        # This inconsistency may break our model, which was trained using X_train.\n",
    "# To account for this potential `get_dummies` issue, we will instead use `OneHotEncoder`.\n",
    "# `OneHotEncoder` is a scikit-learn module that allows us to specify what happens when a new category appears in testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DEEP DIVE\n",
    "# To learn more about how `OneHotEncoder` works, you can read the following link:\n",
    "    # https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html\n",
    "# The development community regularly debates whether `get_dummies` or `OneHotEncoder` better handles categorical data.\n",
    "# If you are curious about the technical discussion surrounding these two approaches, check out the following links:\n",
    "    # https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224051/one-hot-vs-dummy-encoding-in-scikit-learn\n",

    "# With these plots, we can verify the following:\n",
    "    # 1. Whether the model's training loss decreases over the epochs\n",
    "    # 2. Whether its accuracy (for classification) increases\n",
    "    # 3. Or its mean squared error (for regression) moves toward zero.\n",
    "# We can then continue training the model, increasing the number of epochs by 20 on each trial.\n",
    "# After each new trial, we'll again verify that the model's loss and evaluation metric move in the directions we want."
